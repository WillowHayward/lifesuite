# LifeSuite Journal
## A data-driven diary

LifeSuite Journal is in the early stages of development. For more information about it, check out the [design doc](DESIGN.md)

# What does LifeSuite Journal do?
## Horace Wimp, this is your life

A better question would be "what doesn't it do"! To which the answer would be "anything unrelated to life journalling". LifeSuite Journal is a life journalling tool.

Just like with a journal or a diary, at any time you can create an entry (referred to as a "log") about what you're doing or feeling or thinking.

But unlike pesky pen and paper, LSJournal (I got tired of typing out the full thing every time) lets you record data as part of those logs, and then report on that data later. Keeping an eye on your durry consumption? Just include `+smokes:<number>` in your log, and LSJ will store the number you give it next to the `+smokes` tag for that journal entry. Then, after you've done that for a while, you can use the `report` functionality to view whatever kind of data you'd like to about the `+smokes` tag (average per day, total number in July, most in a single day)
